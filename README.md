* ESP32-S2
* ESP32-S3
* ESP32-C3
* ESP8266

### Recommended Specifications

* 2MB+ Flash Memory
* Stable 3.3V power supply

## üíæ Software Requirements

* Arduino IDE 2.0+ or PlatformIO
* ESP Arduino Core 2.0.10
* Required Libraries:
  * ESP-NOW
  * WiFi
  * BLE (for ESP32)
  * ArduinoJSON
  * ESPsomo Core Library

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Option 1: Using Arduino IDE

```
1. Install the Arduino IDE 2.0.10 or newer
2. Install the ESP Arduino Core from the Boards Manager
   - For ESP32: https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32
   - For ESP8266: https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino
3. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ESPsomo.git
4. Open the ESPsomo.ino file in Arduino IDE
5. Select your board from Tools > Board menu
6. Configure settings in config.h
7. Compile and upload to your device
```

### Option 2: Using PlatformIO

```
1. Install PlatformIO Core or PlatformIO IDE extension for VSCode
2. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ESPsomo.git
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Modify platformio.ini as needed for your board
5. Configure settings in config.h
6. Build and upload:
   platformio run --target upload
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Configuration

The basic configuration is done via the `config.h` file or through the web interface after initial setup.

```
// Sample configuration
#define NODE_NAME "kitchen_sensor"
#define NODE_ROLE NODE_ROLE_SENSOR  // Options: NODE_ROLE_GATEWAY, NODE_ROLE_ROUTER, NODE_ROLE_SENSOR
#define MESH_NETWORK_NAME "home_network"
#define MESH_NETWORK_PASSWORD "securepassword123"
#define DEEP_SLEEP_ENABLED true
#define DEEP_SLEEP_INTERVAL 300  // seconds
```

### Network Setup

1. Configure at least one node as a Gateway (connected to WiFi)
2. Configure additional nodes as Routers to extend network range
3. Configure end devices as Sensors (can operate in deep sleep mode)
4. Power on the Gateway first, followed by Routers, then Sensors
5. The network will auto-configure and establish optimal routing paths

### Monitoring and Management

Access the web interface through the Gateway's IP address to:

* View network topology
* Monitor sensor data
* Configure node parameters
* Update firmware
* Export data

## üèóÔ∏è Network Architecture

ESPsomo uses a hybrid mesh architecture with three main node types:

| Node Type | Function | Power Mode | Typical Hardware |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway | Connects mesh to external networks (WiFi/Ethernet) | Always on | ESP32 with stable power source |
| Router | Extends network range, relays messages | Always on | ESP32/ESP8266 with stable power |
| Sensor | Collects data, performs actions | Deep sleep capable | Any ESP device, often battery powered |

Communication within the network uses:

* **ESP-NOW**: For efficient device-to-device communication with low latency
* **WiFi**: For gateway connections and high-bandwidth data transfer
* **BLE**: For energy-efficient connections and smartphone configuration

## üìä Supported Sensors

ESPsomo supports a wide range of sensors including:

### Motion Sensors
* PIR motion sensors
* Microwave sensors
* Ultrasonic distance sensors

### Presence Detection
* mmWave radar sensors
* IR beam break sensors
* Capacitive presence detection

### Environmental Sensors
* Temperature & humidity (DHT11/22, BME280)
* Pressure sensors (BMP180/280)
* Air quality (MQ series, CCS811)

### Light Sensors
* Illumination (LDR, BH1750)
* UV index sensors
* Color sensors (TCS34725)

### Utility Sensors
* Power consumption monitors
* Water flow sensors
* Door/window contact sensors

### Custom Sensors
* Easy integration via I2C
* SPI interface support
* Analog sensor input
